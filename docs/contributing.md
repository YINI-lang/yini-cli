## Intro
Even though `yini-cli` is in beta, your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are **highly valued**.

If you find any bugs, errors or other issues in the YINI parser, if something doesn't work as you expect, or you have other ideasâ€”please make a new issue!

## Quick Development Start

1. Open the terminal in this project's root directory, then run:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
   This will install all needed dependencies.

2. To confirm it even runs:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This should show the help screen of the yini command.  

3. Quick try to parse some YINI file:
   ```bash
   npm run run:parse
   ```
   This will show the ouput of parsing a `sample.yini` file.  

   It will show something similar as to below:
   ```bash
   yini-cli>npm run run:parse

   {
     Service: {
       Enabled: true,
       Cache: {
         Type: 'redis',
         TTL: 3600,
         Options: { Host: '127.0.0.1', Port: 6379 }
       }
     },
     Env: { code: 'dev' }
   }
   ```

4. There are many more ready made scripts to run, see the `"scripts"` part in `package.json` in the root directory.

## Building & Running

For running the `yini` command directly while developing, follow these steps.

1. First, it must be build to include the latest changes.
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Then run the command directly from `bin/` with node.  
   Simulate running: `yini help parse`:
   ```bash
   node ./bin/yini.js help parse
   ```
   Shows the help screen of the `parse` command.  

3. Simulate running: `yini -h`:
   ```bash
   node ./bin/yini.js -h
   ```
   This shows the main help screen for the command.

4. Simulate running: `parse sample.yini --pretty`:
   ```bash
   node ./bin/yini.js parse sample.yini --pretty
   ```
   This outputs the parsed file as prettyfied JSON.
