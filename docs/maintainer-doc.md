In here is **internal-only notes**: Release process, package testing, etc.

## Making/Publishing a New Release on GitHub

1. **First:**
   - **1. a)** Make sure all tests pass by running:
      ```bash
      npm run ci:test
      ```
   - **1. b)** Run below, locally before going to the publishing step: 
      ```bash
      npm publish --dry-run
      ```

2. Then:
   * Check and update `CHANGELOG.md` so it's update with the latest changes.
   * Update the version in `package.json`.

3. **Make a Release on GitHub**
   - Go to **Releases** tab in the repo (`yini-cli`, https://github.com/YINI-lang/yini-cli).
   - Click **"Draft a new release"**, write new tag, version, etc.
   - Click Publish release.

4. **Done!**  
   The package should now be published to the NPM Registry ([www.npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/))

### Test the Published Package

1. **Check if got Published**  
   See if the release was published to npm at all:
   ```
   npm show yini-cli versions
   ```

2. **Install it globally from npm**  
   Install latest version globally:
   ```
   npm install -g yini-cli
   ```

3. **Verify correct/latest Version**  
   Run this in your terminal:
   ```bash
   yini -v
   ```
   Should print the latest version just released (e.g., `1.0.1`).

   Then try printing help:
   ```bash
   yini -h
   ```
   Should show the CLI help for YINI.

4. **Check command-specific help and parsing**  
   Then you may try printing **help for parse**:
   ```bash
   yini help parse
   ```
   This should print the CLI help for the command parse.

   Then try **parsing some yini file**, e.g.:
   ```bash
   yini parse sample.yini
   ```
   This should print the result as a JS object.

   Try **parsing and outputting as pretty JSON**, e.g.:
   ```bash
   yini parse sample.yini --pretty
   ```
   This should print the result as pretty-printed JSON.

   And so on, test the other command, and their options, etc...

5. OPTIONAL: **Check on another machine or in Docker**  
   To simulate a fresh environment:
   ```bash
   docker run -it node:20-alpine sh
   ```

   Then inside Docker:
   ```bash
   npm install -g yini-cli
   yini -h
   ```

6. **Uninstall when Done**  
   Clean up after::
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g yini-cli
   ```
