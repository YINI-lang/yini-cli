# YINI-CLI
**Command-line tool for working with YINI configuration files. Validate, inspect, and convert to JSON with pretty output.**

*YINI aims to be a human-friendly config format: like INI, but with type-safe values, nested sections, comments, minimal syntax noise, and optional strict mode.*

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why YINI?
- **YINI is an alternative** to other great config formats like INI, JSON, YAML, XML, and TOML ‚Äî designed for clarity, simplicity, and straightforward section nesting.
- **Started as a personal project and a research challenge:** Provides structure similar to INI, with features inspired by JSON and YAML.
- **Built for clarity:**
    * Uses concise syntax designed for clarity, especially in nested sections.
    * Supports commonly used configuration structures.
- *Developed to meet practical needs, driven by curiosity and a desire **for configuration clarity, simplicity, minimalism, and flexibility**.

## üí° What is YINI?
- **INI-inspired** ‚Äî with added support for typing, comments, and nested sections.
- **Uses minimal syntax** ‚Äî yet aims to keep maximum clarity.
- Section nesting **without requiring indentation or dot-delimited keys**.
- **Supports strict and lenient modes**, and all major data types.
- Designed for compatibility with both **manual editing** and **automation**.
- üëâ See [how YINI differs from JSON, YAML, INI, and TOML](https://github.com/YINI-lang/yini-parser-typescript/tree/main/examples/compare-formats.md).

## Intro to YINI Config Format
**YINI** is a simple and readable configuration format. Sections are defined with `^ SectionName`, and values are assigned using `key = value`. The format supports common data types (same as those found in JSON), including strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, and lists. 

To learn more, see the [Getting Started: Intro to YINI Config Format](https://github.com/YINI-lang/YINI-spec/blob/develop/Docs/Intro-to-YINI-Config-Format.md) tutorial.

## Usage

### Installation

1. **Install it globally from npm**  
    Open your terminal and run:
    ```
    npm install -g yini-cli
    ```

2. **Verify installation**  
    Run this in your terminal:
    ```bash
    yini --version
    ```
    Should print the version (e.g., 1.0.0).

    Then you may try:
    ```bash
    yini --help
    ```
    Should show you the CLI help for YINI.

3. **Test functionality**  
    Create a simple test file, for example: `config.yini`:
    ```yini
    ^ App
      name = "My App Title"
      version = "1.2.3"
      pageSize = 25
      darkTheme = off
    ```

    Then run:
    ```bash
    yini parse config.yini
    ```

    Expected result, your CLI should output a parsed version of the config and output something similar to:
    ```js
    {
        App: {
            name: 'My App Title',
            version: '1.2.3',
            pageSize: 25,
            darkTheme: false
        }
    }    
    ```
